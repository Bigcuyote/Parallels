# Parallels

Parallels is a game that I am developing with the help of some people. The game is about creating and destroying the world. That's it.+
Now, jokes apart, yeah, basically that's the main idea, create and destroy things at will. The game has an interesting story which is still in development, but we already have the bases of the game.

# Wha?

Okay, okay, I didn't convince myself with the last paragraph, but I can't explain such complex mechanics that easily. For now, you can check the "Game Mechanics" file, to know lil' more bout' how the game is going to work.

# Testing

Until the first alpha release from the game, the game will be private, this meaning YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PLAY IT. (yet)

# Creator(s)

Red Wicked Pixels crew.

# Can I help?

Of course, just send a message to the contact and especify why you want to help in the proyect, you can also summit your own changes, or upgrades to the documents and these will go to revision.

-----That's if 4 now-----
