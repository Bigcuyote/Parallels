# Parallels

Hi and hello, you might already have guessed I'm new to GH (and that I am not native english speaker, sorry for the mistakes)

Anyways, I am developing an new game called Parallels, but it's quite complex. Currently I'm not going to talk to often about it because I don't even have a base. So... yeah. But I can tell that once I have some more documentation about the game, I'm am going to talk about it a lil' more so that people get in touch with the project.

-----That's if 4 now-----
